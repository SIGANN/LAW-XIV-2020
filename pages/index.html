      	<h1>Workshop Description</h1>

      	<p>Linguistic annotation of natural language corpora is the backbone of supervised methods of statistical natural language processing. 
        The <b>L</b>inguistic <b>A</b>nnotation <b>W</b>orkshop (LAW) is the 
        annual workshop of the <b>ACL Special Interest Group on Annotation
          (<a href="http://www.cs.vassar.edu/sigann/">SIGANN</a>)</b>, and it
      provides a forum for the presentation and discussion of innovative research
      on all aspects of linguistic annotation, including the creation and evaluation of
      annotation schemes, methods for automatic and manual annotation, use and
      evaluation of annotation software and frameworks, representation of
      linguistic data and annotations, semi-supervised “human in the loop”
      methods of annotation, crowd-sourcing approaches, and more. As in the
      past, the LAW will provide a forum for annotation researchers to work
      towards standardization, best practices, and interoperability of
      annotation information and software.</p>

      	<h2>Special Theme: Breaking the Mold</h2>
      	<p>This year's special theme is “Breaking the Mold”, promoting novel or less studied types of annotations and data. In addition to general papers, we encourage papers on less common annotations (for example metaphor, sense anaphora, gesture, humor); annotations in understudied settings or data types (new text types or novel collection methods); and annotation for languages other than English, especially beyond tagging/treebanking.</p>
