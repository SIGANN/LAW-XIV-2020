<h2>Submissions and Reviewing</h2>

<p>Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of
interest to the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the
workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should
emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate
clearly the state of completion of the reported results.</p>


<p>A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been
presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.</p>


<p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system. The submission site will be announced shortly.</p>

<p>Long/short paper submissions must use the official ACL 2019 style templates (see <a href="http://www.acl2019.org/EN/call-for-papers.xhtml">here</a>. Long papers must not exceed eight (8) pages of content. Short papers and demonstration papers must not exceed four (4) pages of content. References do not count against these limits.</p>

<p>Note: The supplementary material does not count towards page limit and should not be included in paper, but should be submitted separately using the appropriate field on the submission website.
All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the official style guidelines, which are contained in the template files that will become available on the conference website shortly.
</p>


<p>Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not
include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the
authorsâ€™ identity--e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." should be
replaced with citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers
that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.</p>


<p>Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or
publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs
(<a href="mailto:law-xiv-2020-chairs@googlegroups.com">law-xiv-2020-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>). Authors
of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance
if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.</p>

  
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the program co-chairs.</p>
