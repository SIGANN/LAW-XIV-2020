    <h1>Call for Papers</h1>

    To be posted soon
    <!--
    <h2>Submissions and Reviewing</h2>
    <p>Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of
    interest to the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at
    the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should
    emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate
    clearly the state of completion of the reported results.</p>
    <p>A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have
    been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.</p>
    <p>Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management
    system, which can be found at this address:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.softconf.com/coling2020/LAW/">https://www.softconf.com/coling2020/LAW/</a>
    <p>Long/short paper submissions must use the official COLING 2020 style
    templates (<a href= "https://coling2020.org/coling2020.zip">available
    here</a>), which specify a one-column layout. Long papers must not exceed
    nine (9) pages of content. Short papers and demonstration papers must not
    exceed four (4) pages of content. References do not count against these
    limits.</p>
    <p>Note: The supplementary material does not count towards page limit and
    should not be included in paper, but should be submitted separately using
    the appropriate field on the submission website.</p>
    <p>Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not
    include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal
    the authors’ identity &ndash; e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." should
    be replaced with citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...".
    Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without
    review.</p>

    <h2>Dual Submission Policy</h2>
    <p>Dual submissions are allowed. Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings
    or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs
    (<a href=
    "mailto:law-xiv-2020-chairs@googlegroups.com">law-xiv-2020-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>). In your message, please list the names and dates of the conferences, workshops or meetings where you have submitted or plan to submit your paper in addition to LAW.
    Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of
    acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.</p>

    <h2>Other Questions</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the program
    co-chairs.</p>
